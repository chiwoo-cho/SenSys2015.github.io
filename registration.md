<a href="https://www.regonline.com/sensys2014">SenSys 2014 Registration</a>

The early registration option for conferences and
workshops will be available until 11:59 pm EDT, October 6, 2014. You can reserve
your hotel [here](https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/StarGroupsWeb/res?id=1401295063&key=4447).

To appear at the conference, each paper, posters, and demo must have at least
one unique full (non-student) registration completed by September 25, 2014, 11:59pm PDT. The same registration
cannot count toward two works to be presented at the conference. Authors who are ACM student members should pick the 'ACM Student
Author' category corresponding to their conference to receive a discount. Non ACM member student authors should simply pick the BuildSys: Non-Member
or the SenSys:Non-Member registration type.

####Travel grants for students####
<div id="travelgrant"></div>
With support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), a limited number
of Student Travel Grants are available. Complete application details are
available [here (pdf)]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/documents/student-travel-grant.pdf)

The support is intended to partially cover the costs of attending the conference.
The costs include conference registration, transportation, lodging, and meals.
Students receiving travel awards may be expected to volunteer at SenSys'14.
Such volunteer tasks will not interfere with attendance at conference sessions.

Registration fees are as follows (all prices are in USD):
